# hpad_results_tracking

Athlete development towards elite (medal) success must be appropriately measured over time so that NSOs can adjust their pathways. There is presently (Feb 2020) no standard approach to tracking the progression of performance across sports; each sport employs a different method of performance tracking. 
This project aims to build a tool that will allow HPSNZ and NSOs to acurrately track athlete performance progression. The Sailing Performance Funnels developed by Simon Briscoe are the conceptual basis for this as a starting point, whereby Olympic medallists' annual pinnacle performances are used to frame expectations leading up to a Games competition.

## First phase
Track cycling has been chosen for a host of reasons to be the first sport to use for this tool. These reasons are:
- HPAD methods could be improved in the sport,
- sports results are accessible via _Gracenote_,
- cycling is a tier 1 targeted sport (HPSNZ)

## Data sources
_Gracenote_ will be used as the underlying data source; pinnacle event results for as many as possible Olympic Games medallists will be used. Pinnacle events are nominally World Championship or Olympic Games. 

Considerations on acquiring the data:
1. Track cycling disciplines will be considered first - method to be piloted
2. Individuals versus Teams - separate these cohorts
3. Commonwealth Games will not be considered pinnacle due to a limited depth of field (of nations)
4. Pinnacle performances will be found for identified medallists for as many years preceding the medal-winning performance as possible.
5. Repeat medallists will be given special consideration i.e. these will comprise a subset of the larger dataset.
6. Ideally the junior performances of the medallists will be used, culminating in a final Junior Worlds result before graduation to senior-only competition
